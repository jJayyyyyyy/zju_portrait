##	Dependence

```bash
$ pip3 install pillow
```
	
##	Usage

```bash
$ python3 portrait_maker.py octocat.png
```

where [octocat.png] is any type of image as an input, whose size is better to be larger than 600*600.

##	Demo

<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="./demo/octocat.png" width="320"/>
</td>
<td><img src="./demo/portrait_with_logo.png" width="320"/></td>
<tr>
</table>

##	Workflow

1.  make the input file `portrait.jpg` a square image by adding white space.

2.  resize the image to `640*640`

3.  expand the image to `800*800` by adding white space as its frame

4.  process `logo.png` to get a circle with radius of 100

5.  paste the processed logo onto the bottom-right of the portrait image(that has a white frame)

    ps: the out-of-radius part of the logo has a special alpha value, so it won't be pasted onto the portrait

There is also a [demo](https://github.com/jJayyyyyyy/cs/tree/master/zju_portrait/demo) folder which could help describe the workflow.
